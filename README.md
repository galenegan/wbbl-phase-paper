# Background
This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the results in the manuscript "Phase-resolved shear stress 
and sediment flux profiles in a combined wave-current bottom boundary layer." All of the files needed to generate
the plots are in the `data` folder. The `processing/process_raw_vectrino.py` script (which creates `vectrino.npy`)
relies on the raw Vectrino `.mat` files, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/slhxaac0oswagd6wofz3e/ACGqaqHQxdjgeF-m-k2jozQ?rlkey=kg5au87ykmw3hdmrq4vfuuwnz&st=ax38szu7&dl=0)
